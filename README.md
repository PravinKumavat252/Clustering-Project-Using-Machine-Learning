# Clustering-Project-Using-Machine-Learning

This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning (ML) for clustering data. It utilizes the popular Iris dataset from sklearn to showcase how clustering techniques can be applied to unsupervised learning problems. The project leverages libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, and implements clustering algorithms like K-Means.

## Project Overview
This repository contains an implementation of clustering using the Iris dataset. The goal of this project is to classify the different flower species in the dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. We visualize the clusters and evaluate the clustering performance.

## Key Features
* Dataset: Uses the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in machine learning that contains data about various iris flowers' sepal and petal length and width.
* Clustering: The project primarily focuses on clustering techniques, including the K-Means clustering algorithm.
* Visualization: Visualizes the clusters in a 2D space using matplotlib and seaborn.
* Evaluation: The silhouette score is used to evaluate the clustering performance.
## Requirements
Before running this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

## Files
* clustering_iris.py: The main script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, clustering using K-Means, and visualizations.
* requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project.
* README.md: Documentation for the project.
  
## Detailed Overview of the Code
#### 1. Loading the Dataset:

* The dataset is loaded using load_iris() from sklearn.datasets. This dataset includes attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing:

* The dataset is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
* The features are extracted, and the data is prepared for clustering.

#### 3. Clustering with K-Means:

* The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the dataset to classify the data into clusters (typically 3 clusters for the Iris dataset).
* The optimal number of clusters is determined based on methods like the Elbow Method.

#### 4. Visualization:

* The clusters are visualized in 2D using matplotlib and seaborn to show how the data points are grouped based on the clustering algorithm.
#### 5. Evaluation:

* The silhouette score is used to evaluate how well the clusters are formed. A higher score indicates better clustering performance.

## Example Output
Upon running the script, you will see:

* A 2D scatter plot that shows how the dataset is clustered.
* The silhouette score indicating the quality of the clustering.
* The centroids of the clusters will also be shown on the plot.
## Conclusion

* This project demonstrates how clustering techniques, specifically K-Means, can be used for unsupervised learning on real-world data like the Iris dataset. The project shows how the data can be grouped into clusters based on their similarity, and how evaluation metrics can be used to measure the success of the clustering process.

## Future Work
* Different Clustering Algorithms: Explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Apply techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and better visualization of higher-dimensional datasets.
* Feature Engineering: Experiment with feature scaling and transformations to see how they affect the clustering results.
